# General Information

This is a program to make a robot navigate a maze in VexVR and figure out the shortest path to the exit.



There are 3 folders in this repository, and they are:

* Solving Videos, these are videos of my Robot solving all the mazes on the "Dynamic Wall Maze" playground. The videos will be numbered and there is a word document that has titles above a screenshot of each maze.
* Robot V1, the first version of my robot, which only had the robot exploring the maze. This is only in the repository to demonstrate the different approaches I took to exploring the maze
* Robot v2, the final version of my robot, which explores the maze and finds the shortest path. This is my main submission.



In the robot folders, there are 2 files, one of them is a simple .py file for easy reading and the other is a .vrpython file that can be opened in the VexVR IDE to test the robot.



There is also a video in this repository that is a code walkthrough of my robot. if you can not watch the video, here is a link to it on YouTube -
